Project description: 
Four in a row with a 6x6 board with a dumb AI. Kotlin was the language that is used. In the future I would like to make the AI more diffiult. 

How to use: 
When project is run, the user will have the option to input a number between 0-35 which cell they want to place their token in. If you put an invalid input, the 
program will deny it and ask you to input it again. If the number you put in is a already filled cell, it will print a message telling the user and ask them to try 
again.

Then the game will check if the user won, if so it prints out a win message and ends. If not it continues to the computer's turn. 

After the user goes, a random number will be generated for the computer's turn. There will be a check if that spot is already taken, and if it is a random number will
regenerated. 

Then a turn will be added to a turn counter before checking for computer win. If it did, it will print a you lose message and end. If not it continues back to the
players turn. 

If the player goes 18 times, a message for a tie will print and it will end.
